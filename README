= Ruby Protocol Buffers

Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet
extensible format. Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal
RPC protocols and file formats.

Ruby Protocol Buffers has two components: a compiler to turn .proto definitions
into Ruby modules (extension .pb.rb), and a runtime to use protocol buffers
defined by these modules. The compiler relies on Google's C++ based protoc
compiler for much of the heavy lifting -- this has huge advantages in ensuring
correctness.

This library is heavily optimized for encoding and decoding speed. There is a
small C extension available in the ext/ dir that will improve performance even
further, but it is currently disabled to avoid rubygems having to compile a
native extension. TODO: anybody know if we can make this optional?

== Features

=== Supported Features

 * messages, enums, field types, all basic protobuf features
 * packages
 * imports
 * nested types

=== Unsupported Features

 * required fields are not validated
 * groups (deprecated by Google)
 * extensions
 * options not relevant to Ruby (java_*, optimize_for, message_set_wire_format, deprecated)
 * packed option (could be useful)
 * accessing custom options
 * RPC stubbing

=== Known Issues
 * not tested on Windows
 * type-checking is skipped for repeated fields
 * setting of sub-messages is handled a little oddly, could bite somebody
 * lots of polish still needed in APIs, docs, etc

== Simple Usage Example

  $ echo "package Test; message MyMessage { optional string myField = 1; }" > test.proto
  $ bin/ruby-protoc test.proto
  $ irb -I./lib -rtest.pb
  > msg = Test::MyMessage.new(:myField => 'zomgkittenz')
  => #<Test::MyMessage myField="zomgkittenz">
  > Test::MyMessage.parse(msg.to_s) == msg
  => true

== Installation

You'll need protoc version >= 2.2 (the Google Protocol Buffer compiler)
installed in the environment where you will be compiling protocol buffers. This
is only needed for compiling, you don't need it installed to use the generated
.pb.rb files.

If you use RubyGems, you can install via:

  $ sudo gem install ruby-protocol-buffers

== Source

The source is available on GitHub somewhere. Once I know where, I'll update the
README :)

== License
